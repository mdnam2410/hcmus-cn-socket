# Project details

## 1. Functions need to implement
### 1.1 Screenshot
Features:
1. Taking screenshot from the server
2. Save the screenshot

### 1.2 Running Processes
Features:
1. Get the list of running processes from the server (including process name, ID, and count thread)
2. Kill a process given the process ID
3. Start a process given the process name

### 1.3 Running Applications
Features (similar to running processes):
1. Get the list running applications from the server (including application name, ID, and count thread)
2. Kill an application given the app ID
3. Start a application given the app name

### 1.4 Keylogging
Features:
1. Hooking/unhooking
2. Print the hooked keystrokes

### 1.5 Modifying registries
Features:
1. Modifying registries by sending a .reg file to the server
2. Direct modifying registries by specifying paths and new values. The types of modification:
    * Get values
    * Set values
    * Delete values
    * Create new keys
    * Delete keys

## Shutdown
Feature: Shut the server down

## 2 Client and server message structure
Messages are encoded in ASCII format.
### 2.1 Client messages
All client messages will have the following structure:
```
<command> [<option>]
<data>
```
Where:
* `command` field: A command corresponds to each function, e.g. `process` for the Running Processes function (full list shown later.)
* `option` field: (may be empty) specifies what type of a command, e.g `process kill` to kill a running process.
* `data` field: the data going along with the `command`. For example: `process kill\n123`. This message tells the server to kill the process having ID 123. If the `data` field contains many units, each separated by a `\n`.

### 2.2 Server messages
All server messages will have the following structure:
```
<error code> <message>
<data>
```
Where:
* `error code` field: A three-digit number. `000` is default for no error. All error codes other than `000` indicate that errors have occured at the server (full list of error codes shown later.)
* `message` field: A string describing what the `error code` means. `OK` is the default message for error code `000`.
* `data`: The data returned by the server to the client requirements (e.g. bytes for sreenshot).
